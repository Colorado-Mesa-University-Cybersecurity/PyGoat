## Installation

Run the following commands to install the dependancies for Flask


```bash
	cd app
	
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## Running

To start PyGoat in any Environment run the following command from the app directory:

```bash
	python run.py
```

Note* This requires an installation of Python 3.7+ in the host environment


## Note About Proxies

This is only confirmed to work in the Linux Ubuntu Environment. In windows and IOS it is recommended that you launch the browser from ZAP or BurpSuite

Linux environment with Proxy:

* `chmod +x run.sh`

* `./run.sh`

* If you run using this method without using a proxy, the python requests module will throw some nasty errors. To get around this, if you plan on not running a proxy, use run_no_proxy.sh.


The served web page will be available at http://localhost:5000

* A web proxy like Burp or Zap should work just fine with PyGoat, but if you aren't seeing all the requests, you will have to export the certificate and convert it to a pem file

### Exporting the certificate in burpsuite

* Navigate to proxy->options->import/export ca certificate

* Under export, click 'certificate in DER format' and click next

* choose a location and name for your file and click next to export the certificate

### converting to pem format

* `openssl x509 -inform der -in <new_certificate_name> -out <your_exported_certificate>`

	* e.g. `openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem`

### Using the certificate in PyGoat

	* edit run.sh / run.py depending on the user's chosen launch path

		* set "certificate_path" to the absolute path of your newly converted certificate

		* set "http_proxy" to the address and port for your proxy
		
## Developing

PyGoat uses a relatively simple stack of technology. The backend server uses the Python Flask library and a simple SQLite3 database. The frontend client uses React and a Store class to manage state. Custom lessons and custom navigation pages can be dynamically generated by using the jinja2 template engine that is integrated with flask. Devs can also just use plain HTML to write-up and alter lessons and navigation pages. 

### Important Documentation for Developers

* The Combined Client-Server flow-chart detailing how the various parts of the application work together

* File architecture and descriptions of individual files can be found in architecture.txt in the base directory

* A Figma design for the PyGoat client detailing the UI specifications can be found in the base directory

* Read the README.md located within the app/static directory for information on how the React client and it's Component-Based architecture works. Do not edit client js files because changes will be overwritten whenever you start up the babel transpiler, instead any changes should be made to the parent jsx file. details on locations found in the app/static README

## Creating Custom Lessons

* PyGoat uses yaml files to define its lessons. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/lawalgren/PyGoat/wiki/How-to-create-new-lessons) for more details.
