## Installation

Run the following commands to install the dependancies for Flask


```bash
	cd app
	
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user
```

## Running

To start PyGoat in any Environment run the following command from the app directory:

```bash
	python run.py
```

Note* This requires an installation of Python 3.7+ in the host environment


Linux environment with Proxy:

* `chmod +x run.sh`

* `./run.sh`

Linux environment without Proxy:

* If you run without using a proxy, the python requests module could throw some nasty errors. To get around this, if you plan on not running a proxy, use run_no_proxy.sh.


The served web page will be available at http://localhost:5000


## Note About Proxies

* A web proxy like Burp or Zap should work just fine with PyGoat, but if you aren't seeing all the requests, you will have to export the certificate and convert it to a pem file

### Exporting the certificate in burpsuite

* Navigate to proxy->options->import/export ca certificate

* Under export, click 'certificate in DER format' and click next

* choose a location and name for your file and click next to export the certificate

### converting to pem format

* `openssl x509 -inform der -in <new_certificate_name> -out <your_exported_certificate>`

	* e.g. `openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem`

### Using the certificate in PyGoat

	* edit run.sh / run.py depending on the user's chosen launch path

		* set "certificate_path" to the absolute path of your newly converted certificate

		* set "http_proxy" to the address and port for your proxy
		
## Creating Custom Lessons

* PyGoat uses yaml files to define its lessons. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/lawalgren/PyGoat/wiki/How-to-create-new-lessons) for more details.
