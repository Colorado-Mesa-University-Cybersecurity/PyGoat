<div class="page1">
	<h1>Intercept and modify a request</h1>

	<p>Set up the intercept as noted above and then submit the form/request below by clicking the submit button. When you request is intercepted (hits the breakpoint), modify it as follows.</p>

	<p>Change the Method to GET</p>

	<p>Add a header 'x-request-intercepted:true'</p>

	<p>Remove the request body and instead send 'changeMe' as query string parameter and set the value to 'Requests are tampered easily' (without the single quotes)</p>

	<p>Then let the request continue through (by hitting the play button).</p>

	<p>Note: The two play buttons behave a little differently, but weâ€™ll let you tinker and figure that out for yourself.</p>

	<form action="/proxy" method="post">
		<label for="changeMe">changeMe</label>
		<input type="text" name="changeMe" id="changeMe">
		<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	</form>
</div>
