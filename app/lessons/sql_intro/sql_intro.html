        What is SQL?
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-page-contents">
        <p>Structured Query Language, or SQL is a domain-specific language language for manipulating data stored in a SQL database. </p>
        
        <p>SQL was invented in 1974 based off of a paper by Edgar F. Codd, <a style="font-style: italic;" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362384.362685">A relational model of data for large shared data banks</a>. </p>
        
        <p>In SQL, data is stored in tables, and accessed with regular queries.</p>

        <p>SQL tables consist of intersecting rows and columns that form a 2 dimensional grid with data held in individual cells within this grid.</p>

        <p>Each Column and Row has a label that can be used to query it</p>

        <p>SQL is used on <b style="font-style: italic;">relational</b> databases, and this means that tables can reference other tables. Thanks to this feature, data can be stored in a compact and reusable manner.</p>

        Who uses SQL?
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-page-contents">
        <p>SQL has been adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute, the ANSI, in 1986  and by the International Organization for Standardization, the ISO, in 1987.</p>
        
        <p>The language has since grown to be used in millions of applications both on and off the web.</p>

        <p>36% of the participants in a <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/datagrip/2015/12/23/how-many-sql-developers-is-out-there-a-jetbrains-report/">Poll</a> on StackOverflow confirmed that they have recently worked with SQL</p>

        <p>In 2015, Evans Data Corporation found that there are approximately <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/datagrip/2015/12/23/how-many-sql-developers-is-out-there-a-jetbrains-report/">19 million developers</a> who use SQL in the world</p>

        Why learn SQL?
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-page-contents">
        <p>Today, SQL has implementations in nearly every popular programming language, and thanks to its easy syntax, it is a great database for beginners who haven't worked with many database systems</p>

        <p>SQL is a standardized Specification, which means that the implementation may vary depending on how the designers of the implementation interpret the specification.</p>

        <p>SQL has been baked into many large public and proprietary systems and as such there will always be a demand for SQL developers to maintain these systems</p>

        <p>SQL Statements are really powerful, but many web applications use form data and other forms of insecure data to construct SQL statements. As problems from this anti-pattern pop up, the market will need cyber security experts who are familiar with and can recognize SQL exploits</p>

        SQL Syntax
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-page-contents">
        <p>SQL operations are Statements that declare what you want from the database and how to change it</p>

        <p>An SQL Statement consists of a command followed by other commands, keywords, or names</p>

        <p>For example the following SQL statement will create a new table inside the database called 'temp'</p>

        <p class="lesson-page-example">CREATE TABLE temp</p>

        <p>The SELECT command is the most common way to query data from a SQL table, with wild-cards and logic to refine the search parameters. For Example:</p>

        <p class="lesson-page-example">SELECT * from temp</p>

        <p>The above command would return every row and column from the temp Table</p>
