/*
File: index.js
Description: file defines the View and Controller classes and instantiates them using the imported store Class
				This is designed based on Reacts role as the View in a traditional MVC, but views contain their
				state along with the application state in an object known as the Store instead of a model.
				The MVC pattern is used client side as opposed to server side to create a Single Page Application
				learn more about this MVC implementation here: https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/
				
IMPORTANT!!! If you are reading this from within a .js file, it is important to note that you should not 
	make any changes to that file if you wish to edit the PyGoat client, instead follow the directions on 
	the README.md contained within the static directory. Make sure any editing is done with the .jsx version
	of this file inside the static/jsx directory

Conventions followed:
				4-space tabs
				always place semicolons
				3 empty lines between classes and functions
				2 empty lines between methods
				Class methods always return this unless other return value desired
				annotations follow the convention:     
						function/method  ::  (parameter types) -> (return types)
